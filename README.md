This is a basic project structure for a full-stack application with a Node.js backend and a React frontend.

To get started, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone <repository-url>`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd <project-name>`
3. Run the run script to set up the project: `./run.sh`
4. Navigate to the frontend directory and install dependencies: `cd frontend && npm install`
5. Start the frontend development server: `npm start`
6. Navigate to the backend directory and install dependencies: `cd backend && npm install`
7. Start the backend server: `npm start`

Open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000` to access the React application.

Note: Make sure you have Node.js installed on your system.
